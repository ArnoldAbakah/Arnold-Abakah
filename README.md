# Comparative-Genomics-of-Helicobacter-Pylori-isolates-in-humans

# Project Description
This project endeavors to delve into the comparative genomics of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) isolates from diverse human populations. By employing advanced bioinformatic analyses, the study aims to uncover the variations and similarities in virulent and non-virulent genes across different geographical regions, shedding light on the evolutionary relationships within this pathogen.

# Introduction:
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a pervasive bacterium affecting nearly half of the global population, is implicated in various gastro-duodenal diseases, including gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric adenocarcinomas. Despite its prevalence and significant health implications, the precise mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity remain elusive. This project seeks to explore the genomic landscape of H. pylori strains, elucidating the genetic factors contributing to its virulence and geographical diversity.
